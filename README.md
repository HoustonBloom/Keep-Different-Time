# ☾ Keep Different Time

**A lunar calendar for people who are done living on the extraction schedule.**

The dominant calendar is an extraction schedule disguised as neutral time. Fiscal quarters, Black Friday, Prime Day — every recurring rhythm in mainstream life either organizes your labor or your consumption. Keep Different Time is a shared celestial calendar that organizes community life around the moon instead of the market.

No one owns the moon. No one can move the equinox to maximize Q4 revenue.

## What This Is

A static landing page and printable calendar system built around three tiers of celestial timekeeping:

### Solar Feasts — *four times a year*
| Feast | When | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| The Feast of Transition | Spring Equinox | Celebrate coming out — in all its forms |
| The Feast of Joy | Summer Solstice | Celebrate living outside the closet and outside the lines |
| The Feast of the Elders | Fall Equinox | Honor our heritage, our ancestors, and our elders |
| The Feast of Woes | Winter Solstice | Mock our oppressors and mourn the closet |

### Lunar Sabbaths — *every month*
| Phase | Sabbath | Prompt |
|---|---|---|
| ● New Moon | Bear Each Other's Burdens | Who needs help? What can you offer? |
| ◑ Waxing Moon | Seek Queer Joy | What brings you joy? Where will you go looking? |
| ○ Full Moon | Feast & Share Plenty | Where are we meeting? What did you bring? |
| ◐ Waning Moon | Learn Our History | What are you learning? Who's teaching you? |

### Blue Moon High Sabbaths — *rare, ~every 2.7 years*
- **The Festival of Found Family** — 14 days to celebrate the family you chose
- **The Festival of Estrangement** — 14 days for the losses, the families that couldn't or wouldn't hold us

## Features

- **Live moon phase widget** — calculates the current lunar phase and displays the corresponding prompt
- **Accessible** — WCAG AA contrast ratios, skip navigation, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, `prefers-reduced-motion` support, `forced-colors` support
- **Zero dependencies** — single HTML file, no build step, no frameworks
- **Interactive** — accordion argument panels, drag-to-scroll lunar cards, scroll-tracking side navigation
- **Responsive** — works on mobile, tablet, and desktop

## Getting Started

It's one HTML file. That's the whole thing.

```bash
# clone it
git clone https://github.com/yourname/keep-different-time.git

# open it
open index.html
```

No build tools. No package manager. No node_modules. Just like the calendar itself — the infrastructure is simple so the relationships can be complex.

## Deployment

Drop `index.html` on any static host:

- **GitHub Pages** — push to `main`, enable Pages in repo settings
- **Netlify** — drag the file into the deploy zone
- **Vercel** — `vercel --prod`
- **Literally anywhere** — it's a single HTML file

## Contributing

This project has no copyright, no trademark, and no ownership. Take it. Change it. Make it yours.

If you want to contribute back:

1. Fork the repo
2. Make your changes
3. Open a PR

Some things that would be good to build:
- [ ] Printable PDF calendar template for the current year
- [ ] ICS/iCal export for subscribing in calendar apps
- [ ] Localized solar feast dates (they shift slightly each year)
- [ ] Translations
- [ ] A companion app or shared calendar integration

## Philosophy

The most radical thing you can do is change what clock you live by. This project doesn't tell anyone what to believe. It offers a *when* and a *what kind of energy*. The moon does the organizing. People opt into a rhythm, not a doctrine.

Chosen relationships are more fragile than inherited ones — not because they matter less, but because nothing structural holds them together. A shared calendar gives the family you built the same scaffolding that biological families get by default.

## License

None. Public domain. No rights reserved. The moon doesn't have a license and neither does this.
